	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>I have been tinkering with spaces and computers my entire life. My favorite activity as a child was making elaborate houses out of legos. After completeing the only AutoCAD class at my high school, I went on to study interior design at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. I've worked for several cabinet companies, and that is where my love for the technical side of design came from. I hold an Associates of Applied Science in Archtectural Technology from Arapahoe Community College, as well as over 5 years of experience in Kitchen and Bath design. </p>
